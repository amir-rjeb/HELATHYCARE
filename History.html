                <p>Welcome to <strong>Healthy Care</strong> , a platform dedicated to transforming the dialysis experience by offering solutions tailored to the unique needs of each patient.

                  
                    
                    <p>  This project was born out of the dedication and shared vision of two friends, Amir Rjeb and Samer Arfaoui. Both deeply aware of the challenges faced by dialysis patients and their families, they decided to take action to provide an innovative and compassionate solution. Their goal was simple yet ambitious: to make dialysis care more accessible, flexible, and respectful of each patient's daily life.

                    <p>
                       - Dialysis in a medical center: Aware that some patients prefer a fully supervised medical setting, Amir and Samer also designed a network of modern and well-equipped centers where patients can receive care in complete serenity, supported by experienced professionals.</p>
                   
                    <p><br><br>
